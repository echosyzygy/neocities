    <h1>"Why is [zine] taking so long?"</h1>
    <p>As a not-for-profit, all-volunteer publication, we often do not have the resources to release magazines as frequently as we'd like. We typically have school and jobs that take up all of our time, after which many are too exhausted to contribute to a publication like ours.</p>
    <p>We are proud to stick around after 5 years since our foundation. The magazine is kept alive by dedicated contributors like yourself, working with our own resources to produce quality articles and magazines. However, once we have all the materials to make a new edition, it takes a lot of time and energy to complete - this is where most of the bottlenecks seem to occur. Additionally, some of the resources we use might involve monthly subscription fees.</p>
    <p>The best way to support us after volunteering your time directly is to create a liberapay account and support our team monthly. By donating, you understand that you are supporting the creative vision of lainzine contributors, and we hope you can support us for the work we are doing.</p>
