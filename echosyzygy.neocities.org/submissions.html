    <h1>Submission Guidelines</h1>
    
<p>so you have a cool thing and want to see it in the zine? ok! first thing to
check: what kind of thing is it? generally, what gets sent in will be accepted
(and things will probably stay that way, barring some kind of flood
necessitating that things be rejected). however, there are a few things that
won't (knowingly) be published:</p>

<ul>
<li>misinformation and dangerous advice</li>
<li>things intended to harm others</li>
<li>"political rants" or other rage pieces</li>
<li>low-effort submissions (though that's a bit subjective, granted...)</li>
<li>shameless advertisements (there's a fine line here, though. "check out my cool thing!" is probably ok)</li>
</ul>

<p>a few examples of things likely to go over well:</p>

<ul>
<li>tutorials and technical how-tos</li>
<li>essays or academic research (interesting blog-posts work too!)</li>
<li>short creative writing (fiction, non-fiction, poetry...)</li>
<li>artwork (photography, sketches, glitch-art, whatever)</li>
<li>comics / manga one-shots (would be cool to have more of this stuff)</li>
<li>puzzles, games, or other interactive-type things</li>
</ul>

<p>so that's the what and why. as for how:</p>

<ul>
<li>email all submissions to <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#x6C;&#116;&#x6F;:&#108;&#97;&#105;&#x6E;z&#105;&#110;&#x65;&#64;&#112;&#114;&#111;&#x74;&#111;&#x6E;m&#97;&#105;&#x6C;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#x6D;">&#108;&#97;&#105;&#x6E;z&#105;&#110;&#x65;&#64;&#112;&#114;&#111;&#x74;&#111;&#x6E;m&#97;&#105;&#x6C;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#x6D;</a>, either as attachments or external links</li>
<li>include how you want to be credited (i.e. name, nickname, anonymous, or something else)</li>
<li>please say whether your email address is temporary or if you can be reached there / somewhere else later on (and whether or not you want the address included in "credits" areas). we edit things sometimes, and this provides an opportunity to get back to you with edits / make sure they aren't trampling on artistic style etc.</li>
<li>include any explanations you think are necessary</li>
<li>please specify any preferences you have for presentation of your work (such as whether we should include the line breaks, etc)</li>
</ul>
